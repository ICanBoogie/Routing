# Routing [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ICanBoogie/Routing.svg?branch=2.1)](http://travis-ci.org/ICanBoogie/Routing)

The Routing package provides classes and helpers to handle URL rewriting in native PHP. It
provides an API to redirect incoming requests to controllers. A request is redirected, or
_mapped_, using a dispatcher and routes, which are usually defined in `routes` configuration
fragments but can also be defined during runtime. Controllers usually return a [Response][],
but can also return a string (or a stringifyable object) to produce a simple `text/html` response.





## Dispatching a request

The Routing package provides a [Request][] dispatcher that can be used as a sub-dispatcher by a
[ICanBoogie\HTTP\Dispatcher][] instance, or as a stand-alone dispatcher.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\Routing\Dispatcher;

$request = Request::from([

	'url' => "/articles/123",
	'is_delete' => true

]);

$dispatcher = new Dispatcher($routes);
$response = $dispatcher($request);
```

Before the route is dispatched the `ICanBoogie\Routing\Dispatcher::dispatch:before` event of class
[BeforeDispatchEvent][] is fired. Event hooks may use this event to provide a response and cancel
the dispatching.

If an exception is raised during the dispatching, the `ICanBoogie\Routing\Route::rescue` event
of class [RescueEvent][] is fired. Event hooks may use this event to rescue the route and
provide a response, or replace the exception that will be thrown if the rescue fails.

The `ICanBoogie\Routing\Dispatcher::dispatch` event of class [DispatchEvent][] is fired if 
the route has been dispatched successfully. Event hooks may use this event to alter the response.





## Defining routes

Routes are usually defined in `routes` configuration fragments, but can also be defined during
runtime. The pattern is required to define a route, and the controller too if no location
is defined. The following options are available:

- `class`: If you want or use another class than [Route][].
- `location`: To redirect the route to another location.
- `via`: If the route needs to respond to one or more HTTP methods.

Defined options are copied into the [Route][] instance, even customized ones. Use this
feature if your controller requires additional information about a route.

The [PatternNotDefined][] exception is thrown if the pattern is not defined, and the
[ControllerNotDefined][] exception is thrown if the controller and the location are not defined.





### Defining routes using `routes` configuration fragments

The most efficient way to define routes is through the `routes` configuration fragments because
it doesn't require application logic (additional code) and the synthesized configuration can be
cached.

```php
<?php

// config/routes.php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

return [

	'home' => [

		'pattern' => '/',
		'controller' => 'Website\Routing\Controller'

	],

	'articles' => [

		'pattern' => '/articles',
		'controller' => 'Website\Modules\Blog\Controller'

	],

	'articles:view' => [

		'pattern' => '/articles/:year-:month-:slug.html',
		'controller' => 'Website\Modules\Blog\Controller'

	],

	'articles:new' => [

		'pattern' => '/articles/new',
		'controller' => 'Website\Modules\Blog\Controller',
		'via' => Request::METHOD_GET

	],

	'articles:save' => [

		'pattern' => '/articles',
		'controller' => 'Website\Modules\Blog\Controller',
		'via' => [ Request::METHOD_POST, Request::METHOD_PATCH ]

	],

	'articles:delete' => [

		'pattern' => '/articles/<nid:\d+>',
		'controller' => 'Website\Modules\Blog\Controller',
		'via' => Request::METHOD_DELETE

	]

];
```

Note that using configuration fragments requires [ICanBoogie][].





### Defining routes during runtime

Routes can also be defined during runtime through a [Routes][] instance.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;
use ICanBoogie\Routing\Routes;

$routes = new Routes;

$routes->any('/', function(Request $request) { }, [ 'as' => 'home' ]);
$routes->any('/articles', function(Request $request) { }, [ 'as' => 'articles' ]);
$routes->get('/articles/new', function(Request $request) { }, [ 'as' => 'articles:new' ]);
$routes->post('/articles/new', function(Request $request) { }, [ 'as' => 'articles:create' ]);
$routes->delete('/articles/<nid:\d+>', function(Request $request) { }, [ 'as' => 'articles:delete' ]);
```





## Mapping a path to a route

A [Routes][] instance is used to map paths to routes. A HTTP method and a namespace can optionally
be specified to determine the route more accurately. The parameters captured from the routes are
stored in the `$captured` variable, passed by reference. If the path contains a query string,
it is parsed and stored under `__query__` in `$captured`.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$home_route = $routes->find('/?singer=madonna', $captured);
var_dump($captured);   // [ '__query__' => [ 'singer' => 'madonna' ] ]

$articles_delete_route = $routes->find('/articles/123', $captured, Request::METHOD_DELETE);
var_dump($captured);   // [ 'nid' => 123 ]
```





## Route

Routes are represented by [Route][] instances. They are usually created from route definitions, and
contains all the properties of their definition.

```php
<?php

$route = $routes['articles:view'];
echo get_class($route); // ICanBoogie\Routing\Route;
```

A route can be formatted into a relative URL with its `format()` methods and appropriate properties.
The method returns a [FormattedRoute][] instance which can be used as a string. Its `url` property
holds the URL contextualized with `contextualize()` and its `absolute_url` property holds the
contextualized URL absolutized with the `absolute_url()` function.

```php
<?php

$route = $routes['articles:view'];
echo $route->pattern;      // /articles/:year-:month-:slug.html

$url = $route->format([ 'year' => '2014', 'month' => '06', 'slug' => 'madonna-queen-of-pop' ]);
echo $url;                 // /articles/2014-06-madonna-queen-of-pop.html
echo get_class($url);      // ICanBoogie\Routing\FormattedRoute
echo $url->absolute_url;   // http://icanboogie.org/articles/2014-06-madonna-queen-of-pop.html

$url->route === $route;    // true
```





## Exceptions

The exceptions defined by the package implement the `ICanBoogie\Routing\Exception` interface,
so that they are easy to recognize:

```php
<?php

try
{
	// â€¦
}
catch (\ICanBoogie\Routing\Exception $e)
{
	// a routing exception
}
catch (\Exception $e)
{
	// another type of exception
}
```

The following exceptions are defined:

- [ControllerNotDefined][]: Thrown when trying to define a route without a controller nor location.
- [PatternNotDefined][]: Thrown when trying to define a route without pattern.
- [RouteNotDefined][]: Thrown when trying to obtain a route that is not defined in a [Routes][] instance.





## Helpers

The following helpers are available:

- [contextualize](http://icanboogie.org/docs/function-ICanBoogie.Routing.contextualize.html): Contextualize a pathname.
- [decontextualize](http://icanboogie.org/docs/function-ICanBoogie.Routing.decontextualize.html): Decontextualize a pathname.
- [absolutize_url](http://icanboogie.org/docs/function-ICanBoogie.Routing.absolutize_url.html): Absolutize an URL.





### Patching helpers

Helpers can be patched using the `Helpers::patch()` method.

The following code demonstrates how routes can _start_ with the custom path "my/application":

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\Routing;

$path = "my/application";

Routing\Helpers::patch('contextualize', function ($str) use($path) {

	return $path . $str;

});

Routing\Helpers::patch('decontextualize', function ($str) use($path) {

	if (strpos($str, $path . '/') === 0)
	{
		$str = substr($str, strlen($path));
	}

	return $str;

});
```
